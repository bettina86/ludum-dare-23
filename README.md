DON'T STOP MOVING. Fly through an interstellar grand canyon as the walls slowly
close in on you. Destroy wave after wave of enemies trying to get you. Dual
weapon gameplay, one for killing and another for pushing the walls back.

How To Play
-------------

From the title screen press ENTER to begin the game.

During the game you control your ship with the arrow keys.

As time goes on, enemies will fly at you and the walls will slowly close in.
You have two guns to deal with both of these problems:

Pressing (or holding) X will shoot the Alpha gun, a blue bolt that will kill
enemies. Kill enemies to earn points.

Holding C will charge and shoot your Beta gun. A pink bolt that pushes the
walls back when it hits an enemy.

The bar at the top is your health. It goes down when you take damage. The game
is over when your health goes to 0 or the walls crush you

Tips
------

Some enemies have a chance to drop powerups. The red powerup will restore some
of your health. The blue powerup will improve both of your guns.

Try to get the blue powerups whenever possible, this will improve your Beta gun
so you can push the walls back when they start to close in really fast.
